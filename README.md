This is a svg editor program.

It was made for a class at UOG. We made a library that a GUI could access. This GUI would allow the user to upload a SVG file which this library would check to make sure it's valid. Then the library would find all the elements in the file (lines, circles, squres...etc) and show them to the user with all the attributes attached to them. Then the user could add or delete elements to the svg file and have it saved and sent back the user through the GUI.
